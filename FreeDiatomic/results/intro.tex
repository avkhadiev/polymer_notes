\par SHAKE is one such alternative method built around the Verlet integration sheme. Unlike in the matrix inversion method where constraint equations are solved simultaneously, in SHAKE constraints on each bond are dealt with one-after-one. This process repeats many times until all constraints are satisfied to within a specified tolerance.
