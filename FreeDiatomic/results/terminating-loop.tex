\par After all bonds are considered at the given iteration step $i$, before moving to step $i + 1$, all atoms that were  ``moving'' are considered ``moved'', and no atoms are considered ``moving''.
\par The correction process is repeated until no atoms are considered ``moved'' or the number of iterations $m$ exceeds the specified maximum $M$. At this point, position vectors for all atoms at time $t + \delta t$ are obtained:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{r}_a(t + \delta t) = \mathbf{r}^{(m)}_{a}(t + \delta t)
\end{equation}
