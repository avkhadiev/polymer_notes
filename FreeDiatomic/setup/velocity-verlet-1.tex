\par First, we compute position vectors at full step and velocity vectors at half-step in the absence of constraint forces:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rattle-verlet-1}
\begin{aligned}
	\mathbf{r}^{(0)}(t + \delta t) &= \mathbf{r}(t) + \delta t \mathbf{v}(t) + \frac{1}{2m}\delta t^2 \mathbf{F}(t) \\
	\mathbf{v}^{(0)}(t + \frac{1}{2} \delta t) &= \mathbf{q}^{(0)} = \mathbf{v}(t) + \frac{1}{2} \delta t \mathbf{F}(t)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
