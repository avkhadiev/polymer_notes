  \par A few simplifying assumptions are in order. They will make the math (and subsequent simulation) more tractable; the essential dynamics of a polymer molecule will be preserved.
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Our polymer molecule model is a rigid chain. All interatomic bonds in the molecule have a constant length.
      \item All bonds in the polymer molecule have the same length, labeled $\bondlength$.
      \item All atoms in the polymer molecule have the same mass, labeled $m$.
  \end{enumerate}
