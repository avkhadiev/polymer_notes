  This report consist of two parts:
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item A discussion of the constraint dynamics algorithm based on velocity Verlet numerical integration scheme, \rattle.
      \item A calculation of the kinetic energy of a freely-jointed polymer chain using the bond-vector representation in the CM frame of the molecule.
